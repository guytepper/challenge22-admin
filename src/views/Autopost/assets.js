            'Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nA vegan diet can meet recommendations for protein intake regardless of age, gender or level of physical activity. The key is adequate caloric intake and a varied diet. Protein-packed vegan foods include legumes (beans, peas, chickpeas, fava beans, lupin beans and lentils), soy and soy products (tofu, edamame, tempeh, TVP, soy milk and yogurt, etc.), seitan and quinoa. Nuts and seeds, grains and vegetables also provide varying amounts of protein.\n\nIs it enough?\nHealthy adults require approximately 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day, regardless of gender. This means that a man weighing 70 kg (154lbs) needs to consume approximately 60 grams (~2 oz) of protein per day (70 x 0.8 = 60). Meanwhile, a woman weighing 60 kg (132 lbs) requires 48 grams (1.7 oz). Athletes require more protein, but with proper planning, they can also easily obtain all the protein they need from a vegan diet.\n\nExamples of average amounts of protein in vegan foods:\nLegumes: 15-20 gr (~0.5-0.7 oz)/cooked cup\nTofu: 10-15 gr(~0.5 oz)/100 gr (3.5 oz)\nTVP: 50 gr (1.7 oz)/100 gr dry (3.5 oz)\nSeitan: 22-25 gr (~0.8 oz)/100 gr (3.5 oz)\nNuts and seeds: 15-20 gr (~0.5-0.7 oz)/100 gr (3.5 oz)\nGrains: 5 gr (~0.2 oz)/cup \nBread: 5 gr (~0.2 oz)/2 slices\n\nFor example, one cup of cooked lentils contains the same amount of protein as three eggs (18 grams/0.6 oz) and provides 30% and 37% of the daily protein requirements for men and women, respectively.\n\nIs it sufficient?\nThe quality of protein obtained from a balanced vegan diet is suitable for all bodily needs. You can get high biological value proteins (which provide all the essential amino acids in the right proportions) from soy, soy products, legumes and grains (these do not necessarily need to be eaten during the same meal).\n\nProtein with added benefits?\nIn addition to providing suitable amounts of protein, vegan protein-packed foods come with added benefits. They are low in fat and sodium and high in fiber, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals. A plant-based diet will not only meet your daily protein needs, but will also lower your intake of unhealthy elements found in animal protein and may also increase your intake of healthy nutrients found only in plant foods, such as fiber and phytochemicals.'

            'Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nIron is an important mineral required to prevent anemia and it is particularly important for women at fertility age, pregnant women, adolescents and athletes ‚Äì who have higher iron requirements.\n\nContrary to popular belief, plant-based foods are very rich in iron and it is easy to get all the iron you need from a plant-based diet by following a few simple rules:\nEat iron-rich plant foods: legumes, whole and fortified grains, nuts and seeds (tahini made from unhulled sesame seeds is a great source), dried fruit, green vegetables. \n\nUse these 3 simple tips to improve iron absorption:\nSoak or even sprout your legumes (and also whole grains): soaking not only shortens cooking times, but also improves iron absorption by reduction of phytic acid.\n\nb) Add a vitamin C source to your meal: fresh fruit or vegetables such as bell peppers, tomatoes, fresh salad with lemon juice, kiwis, oranges and strawberries are great sources of vitamin C.\n\nc)Avoid tea, coffee and cocoa during your meal: try to wait at least an hour after your meal before drinking caffeinated beverages.\n\nHave you been told animal products are the best source for iron? Think again. Not all animal products are rich sources of iron. Chicken, for example, is actually very low in iron. For comparison, to get the same amount of iron that is in one cup of legumes or 1-2 tablespoons of tahini, one would have to eat 3-5 chicken legs or almost a pound of chicken breast!\n\nIt is true that iron from plant-based foods is more sensitive to iron absorption inhibitors (which can be easily dealt with as mentioned previously), while iron from animal products is absorbed whole, without the possibility for the body to regulate absorption according to its needs ‚Äì but there is a catch!\n\nResearch indicates that excess absorption of iron can be detrimental to your health. This is because iron is an oxidant, which can harm blood vessels and increase carcinogenic processes. In fact, iron from animal-based foods has been linked to colon cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. It is possible that this association is also influenced by other factors present in meat, such as saturated fats, cholesterol and more.\n\nEating a plant-based diet is a great way to get all the iron you need with extra health benefits.'

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nThere is an ongoing debate regarding the amount of calcium required to maintain healthy bones and prevent osteoporosis. For example, the recommendation for adults in the US is 1000-1200mg daily (which gave rise to the '3 a day'campaign by the dairy industry), while the in the UK it is 700mg.\n\nStudies show that vegans, especially those who eat relatively low amounts of salt and processed foods, may require even lower amounts of calcium per day ‚Äì 500-600mg. Still, as there is no specific recommendation for vegans as of now, in the meantime it is best to follow the official recommendations and make sure you have enough calcium in your diet. This should be very simple.\n\nGood sources for calcium in a vegan diet:\n- Legumes ‚Äì especially white beans and soy\n- Soy products (especially fortified) ‚Äì tofu, soymilk, soy yogurt\n- Nuts ‚Äì especially almond\n- Unhulled sesame tahini ‚Äì up to 7-10 times more calcium than ordinary white tahini.\n- Green vegetables ‚Äì broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, green and yellow beans, okra, leeks, and leafy greens.\n- Fruits ‚Äì figs, oranges, carob, and carob-based products.\n- Whole grains ‚Äì especially oats.\n- Seitan (calcium fortified) ‚Äì It is recommended to go for natural-flavor or frozen seitan, as other varieties can contain large amounts of salt or oil.\n\nIt should also be noted that besides calcium, there are other important dietary factors for maintaining healthy bones: vitamin D, vitamin C, magnesium, phytochemicals, isoflavones (found in soy), physical activity and avoidance of cigarettes and excessive alcohol intake."

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nA plant-based diet provides all the vitamins and minerals you need, except for one ‚Äì vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 originates from bacteria that are found in soil, dirt, feces and non-purified water. Apparently, in the distant past, B12 sources were unclean food and non-purified water. Nowadays, we‚Äôve eliminated dysentery, cholera and other infectious diseases, a welcome advancement on our part, but we have also lost a reliable source of B12.\nÔøΩWhy is vitamin B12 important? It prevents anemia and keeps our nervous system healthy. A lack of vitamin B12 may lead to nerve and brain damage.\nÔøΩSo, how can we get vitamin B12? The only reliable source of B12 in a vegan diet is a supplement, produced from those same bacteria (don't worry; B12 supplements are not animal by-products). \n\nIt is best to use a sublingual B12 supplement and not rely on multivitamins that contain b12, because their dosage is typically too small. Contrary to rumors that are being spread on Facebook and all over the internet, it is *impossible* to get B12 via spirulina, fermented foods, nutritional yeast, or any other plant-based food.\nÔøΩIt's pretty simple: Studies show time and time again that vegans have low B12 levels if they do not take a supplement, and have sufficient B12 levels when they do. So, the solution is simple ‚Äì just take B12. It should be noted that vitamin B12 deficiency also prevails in humans who eat meat, especially in people over 50 years old, due to its complex absorption mechanism. It's also important to know that vitamin B12 supplements typically have no side effects. They are water soluble and have no tolerable upper intake level, so don't worry about taking B12 supplements if you don't have a deficiency ‚Äì they don't build up or pose a health risk.\nÔøΩWhich type of supplement is best? All the supplements on the market are suitable, and they all typically contain high dosages of the vitamin (500-5000 mcg) because of its complex absorption mechanism.\nÔøΩHow much of the vitamin B12 supplement should you take? For people with no deficiency ‚Äì a 1000 mcg sublingual supplement 2-3 times a week should be enough. For pregnant and lactating women, a daily intake is recommended to maintain a steady supply for the fetus/baby. Individuals with deficiencies are usually advised to supplement on a daily basis, but should consult with a doctor or a dietitian."

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nThe fear of carbs often surfaces among new vegans. Carbs may be considered 'fattening', but that actually isn't the case.\n\nWhy are people so afraid of carbs?\nPopular high-protein, low-carb diets, such as Atkins and Paleo, encourage people to ban carbs. These diets are controversial, as they are rich in meat, eggs and high-fat dairy and thus may have deleterious health effects.\n\nEating the wrong type of carbs: different kinds of carbs can have a different effect on our weight, health and satiety. They can be divided to 3 groups:\na) Simple sugars: found in sweets (cakes, cookies, ice creams, candy and so on), soft drinks and fruits.\nb) Complex, low-fiber carbohydrates: found in refined grains such as white bread, white rice, breakfast cereals and so on.\nc) Complex, high-fiber carbohydrates: Found in whole grains and legumes.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to base your carbohydrate intake on the third group and to limit your intake from the two first groups.\n\nBut aren't carbs more fattening than protein?\nNope. Both carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, while fat contains 9 calories per gram.\n\nSo why do some people say carbs caused them to gain weight?\nUsually because of two reasons:\nThey eat the wrong kind of carbs (as mentioned above), which may also be accompanied by lots of fats (in snacks, pastries and fries).\nThey forget to add protein to their diet, and therefore may not feel full, thus tending to eat more.\n\nWhat is the solution, you ask?\nEating good carbs throughout the day and making sure to eat protein-rich food such as legumes, soy and soy products, quinoa, seitan and a moderate amount of nuts and seeds.\n\nGenerally speaking, what should a vegan who is looking to maintain or lose weight do?\nUp with the veggies: Eat plenty of vegetables throughout the day and fill half your plate with vegetables during your meals.\nPrefer whole, plant-based foods such as legumes, whole grains and vegetables.\nConsume nuts, seeds and nut butters and spreads in moderation. While they are very nutritious, they're also high in calories.\nTry to avoid processed foods and snacks as much as possible.\nTry to eat more home-cooked meals. If you're eating out, choose from the menu wisely. Prefer fresh, cooked or baked food over fried food.\nSnack on fruits: have 1-3 servings a day, between meals. Avoid drinking fruit juices and smoothies.\n\nFinally, the most important aspect of the weight loss process is the framework in which it is conducted. Whether it is with the guide of a dietitian or with a support group, find solution that works best for you."

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nSoy is a special, healthy legume that's packed with high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals. There are plenty of products made of soy, such as edamame, soy milk, tofu, tempeh, TVP and more. Fortified soy products are also a great source of calcium, and one serving of fortified tofu, soy milk or yogurt may provide 20-50% of your daily calcium requirements.\nSoy products are highly controversial. Let's examine the issues one by one:\n\nSoy and cancer: soy contains isoflavones. Isoflavones are selective estrogen receptor modulators. That means they are similar in chemical structure to estrogen, but their hormonal effect is very weak. There is actually significant evidence, from many scientific studies, that moderate intake of traditional soy foods (such as edamame, tofu and tempeh) is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer in men and of breast cancer development and recurrence in women. The American Cancer Society (ACS) 2012 dietary guidelines for cancer prevention also support soy consumption as part of a healthy diet. Regarding more processed soy products, such as TVP and mock meats ‚Äì their effect appears to be neutral.\n\nSoy and thyroid: soy does not have an adverse effect on thyroid gland function and does not increase the risk of hypothyroidism. Existing hypothyroidism should be medically treated and does not require the elimination of soy from one's diet. It should be noted that soy products should not be consumed with thyroid medications, because they may affect their absorption.\n\nSoy and sexual development: according to studies on human subjects, soy does not appear to have adverse effects on sexual maturity and development, male reproduction or breast size.\n\nSoy and mineral absorption: soy, like many other whole plant foods, contains phytate. Phytate limits the biological availability of minerals such as iron, calcium and zinc. There are plenty of ways to reduce phytate quantities in soy, such as soaking, sprouting, leavening and fermenting.\n\nSoy and GMO: most soy grown for human consumption is GMO-free. If you are concerned with GMO, just check for \"GMO-free\" on the product label. It should be noted that there is no scientific evidence that GMO has negative effects on our health.\n\nSoy is considered safe throughout the cycle of life ‚Äì from childhood to old age ‚Äì as part of a balanced diet. So where does all the fear come from, you ask? Mainly from studies on animals, where high-dosage isoflavones were used (not soy-based foods, and not a typical dosage). The results of these studies cannot and should not be interpreted to be reflect the effects soy consumption has on humans. It should be noted that when it comes to cancer, soy is considered safe, but the data regarding isoflavone supplements is conclusive, and therefore should not be used in cases of history with breast cancer.\nCan you be vegan without eating soy, due to a soy allergy or personal choice?\n\nThough it‚Äôs a shame to forgot such a nutritious and easy-to-use ingredient, you can be vegan without soy. Just make sure to eat plenty of other legumes, such as peas, lentils, chickpeas and all types of beans."

Since not all children typically consume the entire variety the vegan diet has to offer, it's important to make a smart transition.\n\nInstead of just eliminating animal products from the daily menu, first add new foods, then remove the problematic ones. It may get frustrating from time to time, and it's important to be patient and keep offering your kids new foods, even if they've declared in the past that they don't like them.\n\nIt's good to know that the more accustomed children are to eating healthy from a young age, the better the chances they will grow to be adults who enjoy healthy food. Not only that, but in our experience, children who are vegan from infancy are usually more open to trying new flavors and food textures.\n\nLegumes are a key ingredient for children as well as adults. They are an important source of protein, iron and zinc, all vital for growth. If your children aren't used to eating legumes, it's important to allow them to get used to them before eliminating meat and other animal products from their daily menu, so as not to let an unbalanced diet affect their growth process.\nIt's a good idea to start with legumes that are easier to digest, such as lentils, tofu, peas and mung beans, and then move on to more complex legumes. To make things even easier on small digestive systems, we recommend sprouting, or at least soaking legumes before cooking.\n\nIt's important to incorporate healthy sources of calcium into a child's daily menu: tofu, soy milk, white beans, broccoli, tahini, green beans and oranges are all good examples. Speaking of soy milk, it's way more nutritious than other types of plant-based milk, which usually contain only a small amount of protein (check the box at the supermarket and see for yourself).\n\nWe recommend incorporating healthy fats into your child's daily diet, such as olive oil, avocados, tahini and nut butters. This is particularly important for young children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, and so on, particularly if the child is not a big eater in general.\n\nFor small children who are not big eaters, it's a good idea to let them fill up on foods that are rich in protein, minerals and calories. Save fresh vegetables for snacks or for after large meals.\n\nAnd what about picky eaters? There are many ways to incorporate legumes, nut butters and tofu into dishes for particularly suspecting children. Try lentil burgers or breaded tofu sticks, use lentil or chickpea flour in different baked goods, or even try mashing some white beans in with your mashed potatoes. You can find more ideas here: http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/vegan-recipes-your-kids-will-love/\n\nYou can also ask here in the group, of course, and our mentors will be happy to give you more tips and ideas.\n\nWe also recommend, as many parents prefer, to consult with a vegan dietitian to help children transition to veganism in a smooth, healthy way. We definitely encourage seeking professional help."

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nOne of the greatest health benefits of plant-based nutrition is its role in the prevention of heart disease.\n\nThe largest vegetarian and vegan health study ever performed, the Epic-Oxford study, found that risk of cardiovascular disease was 32% lower among vegetarians compared to omnivores (independent of factors such as gender, age, smoking, and level of physical activity).\nEven independent of body weight, which tends to be lower in vegetarians and vegans, omnivores still showed a 28% higher risk for cardiovascular disease than vegetarians and vegans.\n\nCardiovascular disease can lead to stroke, high blood pressure, heart attacks and death.\n\nAn April 2014 study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association evaluated findings from seven clinical trials and 32 observational studies on the health results of vegetarian and vegan diets.\nThe study found that vegetarian and vegan diets lead to a reduction in mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure as compared with the omnivorous diet.\n\nThese results show that switching from an omnivorous diet to a vegetarian or vegan diet has the same blood pressure benefits as losing 5 kg of weight or adopting a low-sodium diet.\n\nHow does a vegan diet make your heart happy?\nIt's a great combination of 'in with the good, out with the bad'! On the one hand ‚Äì you avoid red and processed meat, cholesterol-packed foods, high saturated fats and other unhealthy elements associated with animal-based foods. On the other hand ‚Äì you consume more heart-healthy foods such as legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables packed with fiber, vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants."

            'Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nDiabetes is the one of the leading causes of death in the world and its prevalence is rising.\nIt is also a risk factor for other chronic diseases that may be fatal such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.\n\nDiabetes increases the risk for many serious health problems such as blindness, neuropathy, impaired injury healing, gastroparesis, kidney failure and limb amputation.\n\nThe good news? A vegan diet has been found to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes. For example, researchers found a 70% lower risk for vegans in the Adventist community study in the US, compared to omnivores.\n\nMore good news? Studies also show that a vegan diet can be very helpful in maintaining better glucose and lipid levels in diabetic patients. Therefore, it may reduce risk of complications.\n\nOne interventional study even found that a low-fat vegan diet is more beneficial than the dietary recommendations of the American Diabetes Association.\n\nBut what about the carbs? Contrary to common belief, diabetes is not caused by eating a lot of carbs. It is a complex disease with both genetic and behavioral factors.\n\nThe western diet ‚Äì high in animal products, sugar, salt and fat and low in whole, plant-based foods and fiber ‚Äì is strongly associated with an increased risk of diabetes. On the other hand, decreased risk of diabetes is associated with high consumption of vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts.\n\nBut can a diabetic eat a high-carb diet? Yes. Even the ADA recommends that 45-65% of the calories consumed per day should be from carbs. The trick is to use the right type of carbs and to eat small portions throughout that day. Consuming complex carbohydrates from fiber-rich, whole, plant-based foods ‚Äì legumes and whole grains ‚Äì divided into small portions throughout the day can be a great strategy for diabetic patients.\n\nFor people with diabetes it is recommended to meet a vegan-friendly dietitian in order to get a personalized eating plan.'

This menu is very similar to the ‚Äúordinary‚Äù menu, with a few modifications. People with celiac may wish to visit a vegan-friendly dietitian in order to better adjust the menu to their personal needs and preferences.\n\nBreakfast options:\nHomemade Muesli: puffed quinoa/gluten free cereal + plant-based milk (soy/almond/nut etc.) / soy yogurt + fruit and/or nuts\nSandwich: gluten free bread / rice cakes + avocado / hummus / homemade tofu spread / homemade bean spread / olive tapenade / natural peanut butter etc. + fresh vegetables.\n\nSnack options:\nA handful of almonds and other nuts (walnuts, pecans, cashews, hazelnuts, brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, etc.)\nA slice of gluten free bread / rice cakes with your favorite spread\nSliced vegetables with a vegan dip such as tahini / hummus / guacamole.\n\nLunch options:\nCooked gluten-free grains, legumes and vegetables such as: pasta Bolognese with gluten-free pasta and soy flakes (TVP); rice and beans/lentils; stuffed peppers with rice/quinoa and beans/peas/lentils; stir-fried tofu with rice noodles and vegetables\nBean and vegetable soup with gluten-free bread.\nSandwich: 2 slices of gluten-free bread/bun/pita with vegan patties (based on legumes/TVP/tofu) and vegetables\nSalad meal: big salad with legumes / tofu, rice/pasta/corn\n\nSnack options:\nEdamame\nFruits (fresh or dried)\nA slice of gluten-free bread / rice cakes with a spread\nVegan yogurt with fruit.\n\nDinner Options:\nChickpea flour omelet / tofu scramble with gluten-free bread and salad\nAny option from lunch\n\nMen should add approximately 300-500 calories from healthy foods to this menu.

            "What is gluten?\n\nNataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nGluten is a protein that is found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye. It's found in most breads, cereals, pastas and many processed foods. It is also the main ingredient of seitan, which makes up a lot of the mock meats on the market.\n\nPeople who have celiac disease develop an immune reaction to gluten that damages the intestine, so they need to avoid gluten. For most other people, there is no real need to avoid gluten.\n\nCan I be a gluten-free vegan?\nYes, you can! You can enjoy foods from all the vegan food groups. Just make sure to choose gluten-free grains and packaged products that are labeled gluten-free, and avoid seitan and mock meats that contain wheat protein.\n\nThe gluten-free vegan food groups are:\nProtein-packed foods: legumes (beans, peas, chickpeas, fava beans, lupin beans, lentils), soy and soy products (tofu, edamame, tempeh, TVP, soy milk), quinoa.\nGluten-free grains: teff, rice, buckwheat, corn, gluten-free oats, amaranth, gluten-free breads, crackers and cereals.\nFruit and vegetables.\nNuts, seeds and nut and seed butters (such as peanut butter and tahini)."

            "Nataly Shemesh, Challenge 22+ registered dietitian explains:\nThe only supplement every vegan needs to take is vitamin B12. If you have a balanced vegan diet consisting of legumes, grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds in suitable amounts, you should get all the nutrients you need.\n\nIron, calcium and zinc: you can get all these minerals from legumes (especially after soaking or sprouting), whole grains, green vegetables, fortified foods, nuts and seeds. As vitamin C increases iron absorption,\nit's best to add a good source to your meals, such as fresh salad, tomatoes or bell peppers.\n\nIodine: you can get iodine from iodized salt and sea vegetables.\n\nOmega 3: you can get omega 3 (alpha-linolenic acid) from flaxseed, chia seeds, hemp, canola oil and walnuts.\n\nVitamin D: our diet has little to do with vitamin D levels, as its main source is endogenic production after exposure to sunlight. In cases of deficiency, a supplement is the best solution. Most supplements contain cholecalciferol ‚Äì vitamin D3 from an animal source, but you can get vegan supplements based on D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 from lichen.\n\nIt should be noted that in cases of existing deficiency, pregnancy, lactating, infants under one year old or individuals with specific medical conditions which require supplementation (regardless of being vegan), you should consult with a physician or dietitian."

            "Weight Gain Tips\n\nWhile many of us are afraid of weight gain, people who were very thin before their transition to a vegan lifestyle may have the opposite problem ‚Äì rapid weight loss.\n\nFirst of all, don't panic! If you've recently transitioned to a plant-based diet and you've lost a few pounds, it's important to keep track and see if you continue losing weight after the first month. If you find that your weight has stabilized, it's possible that your new weight is more appropriate for your body. If you continue to lose weight, or if you were underweight to begin with, try the following tips:\n\n- Have lots of small meals. Most vegan food is low in calories and is digested quickly. Multiple small meals will help you increase the amount of food you eat.\n- Eat plenty of nuts in different forms. Make a habit of eating a couple of handfuls of various nuts each day. You can combine them with raisins and other dried fruit, put them in salads or hot dishes, or try nut spreads and butters.\n- Eat lots of tahini (the kind made from whole sesame seeds is better), peanut butter, avocadoes and olive oil. If other household members are trying to maintain their weight, add a topping of these high-fat ingredients to your own personal servings.\n- Exercise moderately. While exercise is usually considered to be helpful when you're trying to lose weight, it can also help you gain weight, as it increases your appetite and helps build muscle mass.\n- Don't be tempted to base your diet on junk food. You may have heard this before: 'Gaining weight is easy! Just gobble down lots of fries, processed non-dairy cheese, chips and candy.' It's true that if you're naturally thin, you can be less strict than others when it comes to eating junk food. However, even if junk food doesn't make you gain weight, it can cause your diet to be unbalanced, increasing your risk of various diseases. You can treat yourself to your favorite form of junk food every once in a while, but be sure not to make it the base of your daily menu.\n- A fruit smoothie with soy milk can make a great breakfast or snack. Add nuts, chia seeds or your favorite nut butter.\n- Whether you're trying to gain weight or lose it, it's always a good idea to get help ‚Äì seek a vegan dietitian or support group in your area."
